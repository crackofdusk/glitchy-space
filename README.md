# Glitchy space

This is a music visualization demo using [aurora.js](https://github.com/audiocogs/aurora.js) and related decoders for audio decoding and [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) and [tween.js](https://github.com/sole/tween.js/) for visualizations.

The code was put together quickly at a hackaton. I may or may not clean it up some day.

Note that the demo requires WebGL and Web Audio API support. If it doesn't work for you, try it in the latest version of Firefox or Chrome.

## Usage

1. Open index.html in your browser.
2. Click on the play button to chose a track to play (supported formats: MP3, AAC, FLAC, ALAC).
3. ??? (actually, wait a few seconds for the track to start playing)
4. Profit

## Todo

* Better beat detection (possibly using the Echonest API)
* More/better glitch effects?
